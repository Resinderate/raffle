## Reports.

http://msandrews.mur-phy.com/reports/

A tool to help with end of year report writing. Teachers usually have a bank of common feedback they use as a template and copy paste/replace names pronouns. Implemented this as a web UI to allow to simply click all the feedback they want to use and will be combined together into an output box.

## Raffle

Used as a way of tracking points as a leaderboard for students, being able to give them tickets throughout a period, and then be able to draw a "winner" which is a weighted random draw of the students based on how many tickets they have.
